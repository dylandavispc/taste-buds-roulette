## Tastebuds- A roulette style restaurant picker for friends!

This is a full stack web application that picks a random restaurant in the area entered. To register, all you need is an email address and a password. Once logged in, you have the ability to add your closest friends. Once the friends are chosen, you will have the ability to add a location, time and date of the event. Click on the spin and the application will choose a restaurant for you and your friends. If you do not like the location chosen, you will have the ability to spin again.


### How to launch

2) Install all NPMs

This is the main page of the application. Here you will be able to add "Buds" or friends and you can delete them as well. Once you add your Buds, you can select the specific location where you and your buds want to eat. You can then enter the date and time of the even and select spin.

Once you spin, the application generates a random place for you and your buds to eat. If you do not like the place chosen or just want to select a different location, you have the ability to spin again.
