## Tastebuds- A roulette style restaurant picker for friends!

This is a full stack web application that picks a random restaurant in the area entered. To register, all you need is an email address and a password. Once logged in, you have the ability to add your closest friends. Once the friends are chosen, you will have the ability to add a location, time and date of the event. Click on the spin and the application will choose a restaurant for you and your friends. If you do not like the location chosen, you will have the ability to spin again.
